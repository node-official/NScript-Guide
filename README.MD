# NScript

### NScript is a powerful programming language developed for speed, multi-platforming development and easy to learn syntax.
Syntax based on C, C++ and Lua.

Basic example:
```nscript

func Main << () -> {
    string{} name;
    $.cin{<< ("What is your name?")} >> name;

    $.cout << "Hello, " << name << $.endl;
}

```
